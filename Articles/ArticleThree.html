                    Season 2 of Vinland Saga shows the aftermath of Thorfinn's
                    life and childhood at war, which leaves him hollow and
                    guilt-ridden. His almost robotic persona is similar to the
                    title character from Violet Evergarden, who also grew up as
                    a child soldier. More than coincidence, the similarities
                    between these two protagonists is entirely reflective of the
                    devastating impact of war on their young lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When handling the subject of war, both Vinland Saga and
                    Violet Evergarden take on different tones and begin their
                    stories at different points: Vinland Saga shows the gritty
                    horrors of Thorfinn's childhood firsthand, while Violet
                    Evergarden offers a glimmer of hope as Violet takes her
                    first steps as a retired veteran. Though Vinland Saga shows
                    more of Thorfinn's painful development, in the end, the
                    impact of war on the battlefield is similar for both
                    characters.

                    Though it is Thorfinn's brash behavior in his childhood that
                    leads him into danger, it's his drive for revenge that keeps
                    him in the company of the brutal Vikings. When his father
                    Thors, a former Viking, is called to war, the young boy
                    sneaks aboard his boat in search of adventure and battle. An
                    unexpected ambush ends with the assassination of Thors,
                    which young Thorfinn witnesses. Numb from his loss, he is
                    found stranded on the boat stolen by his father's killers by
                    a group of mercenary Vikings led by Askeladd, who becomes
                    the target of Thorfinn's revenge. Askeladd uses Thorfinn in
                    his war efforts, pushing the boy to kill one target after
                    the next and causing him to become bitter and aggressive --
                    Thorfinn's contempt toward Askeladd becomes his entire
                    raison d'être. Despite all his years of effort, Thorfinn
                    fails to take Askeladd's life, resulting in a mental break.
                    Season 2 features an older Thorfinn who has lost his will to
                    fight -- with his life on the warfront potentially behind
                    him, Thorfinn struggles to find his will to keep on living.

                    Both Thorfinn and Violet were used as child soldiers to
                    fight an adult's war. Though Violet's motivations go from
                    survival to support as she develops a relationship with the
                    Major, and Thorfinn's motivations are purely guided by hate,
                    they are both left with emotional scars which stunt their
                    personal growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unlike Violet, Thorfinn has more to gain by following
                    Askeladd's commands and is driven by his own personal goals.
                    However, because he doesn't question any of Askeladd's
                    commands and appears to have more loyalty than necessary, he
                    acts as the perfect soldier, without a life off the
                    battlefield. This is also how Violet becomes after her
                    childhood. As they both grow up, their ability to develop
                    relationships is jeopardized -- Thorfinn doesn't become
                    close to anyone and Violet doesn't understand how. When
                    their time at war come to an end, a peaceful civilian life
                    proves to be impossible for either of them.

                    For Thorfinn, rather than finding his way home to his mother
                    and sister, he finds himself stuck as a slave. With his
                    originally determined spirit extinguished from wartime
                    losses, he is taken advantage of by mercenaries and spends
                    his days isolated only following the goals of his new
                    master, who treats him kindly. This is how Season 2 opens,
                    drastically changing the tone of the franchise to something
                    more hopeful and upbeat. Much of this has to do with the
                    number of positive influences in Thorfinn's life at this
                    point. As a child, the only mentor figure he had was
                    Askeladd, who abused him and made no personal attachments
                    aside from mutual hatred. In his older years, Thorfinn is
                    introduced to a peaceful community held together by slaves
                    and their master, who cares for their wellbeing. As Thorfinn
                    begins to heal from his life as a soldier with the
                    supportive help of the new character Einar, there's hope
                    that Thorfinn will find a new way to live happily.

                  <p>
                    In Violet's case, having the right people in her life made
                    for an easier transition, but not one free of struggle. She
                    couldn't begin to understand human emotions and her own
                    self-expression because it was never necessary as a soldier.
                    This toxic environment is also because most of the adults
                    she grew up with created a culture against emotions and
                    focused on military success instead. As the only person who
                    stood to make change, the heartwarming words of Major
                    Gilbert gave her a hint of what emotions felt like.
                    Thankfully Violet is introduced to a profession that would
                    allow her to explore feelings in a healthy way. The Major's
                    friend Claudia Hodgins, a former commander of the
                    Leidenschaftlich army comes to Violet's aid as she enters
                    civilian life. When he sees her unrest, he hires her to work
                    in his postal company. After discovering the profession of
                    ghostwriting civilian letters and seeing Hodgin's "Auto
                    Memory Dolls" at work, she discovers a new goal of helping
                    civilians from all walks of life deliver their feelings and
                    thoughts to their loved ones. This, in turn, helps Violet
                    explore her feelings and especially her grief from wartime.

                    While Vinland Saga is far more action-oriented than the
                    drama-filled Violet Evergarden, both anime are centered
                    around a protagonist who grows up in the middle of a war and
                    is molded by it. These two series handle their themes of
                    war, grief, and healing with patience and care as Thorfinn
                    and Violet make strides overcoming their emotional
                    struggles. Violet's story has come to an end with her rising
                    above the tragedy of her horrific upbringing. With a lighter
                    change in tone, there's hope that Thorfinn will eventually
                    do the same.
