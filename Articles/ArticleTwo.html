              While Re:Zero's Rem was introduced as nothing more than a
              supporting character, she's quickly grown in popularity and
              notoriety.

                  Since its release, few isekai anime have managed to become as
                  popular and well-received as Re:Zero - Starting Life In
                  Another World. The series successfully subverted many popular
                  isekai tropes, particularly the power fantasy of protagonist's
                  being powerful legendary heroes, instead opting to make its
                  main protagonist Subaru Natsuki quite weak, with his main
                  power being able to die over and over again only to "respawn"
                  at a temporal checkpoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since Subaru is so weak, he relies on the strengths and
                  abilities of the series' supporting cast, which more often
                  than not ends up being the young Oni girl, Rem. While Rem's
                  role seemed relatively small at first, with her sister Ram
                  initially being the more central of the twins, this quickly
                  changed and resulted in her becoming one of the most beloved
                  anime characters of all time. Rem ended up not only surpassing
                  her sister in popularity, but even the Re:Zero's main female
                  protagonist, Emilia.

                  Everyone loves an underdog, and this couldn't be more true
                  when analyzing Rem. Throughout Re:Zero, Rem is more often than
                  not presented as the character at a disadvantage, whether it
                  is in battle, love, or story relevance. When she is introduced
                  at Roswaal's estate, she's actually treated as a relatively
                  minor character. Subaru has already bonded and fallen for
                  Emilia, and while working at the mansion, Ram befriends him
                  before anyone else, making Rem seem rather irrelevant. It
                  isn't until Subaru is murdered at her hands that she actually
                  gets development and becomes a main fixture in the story. The
                  rest of that specific arc ends up focusing entirely on Subaru
                  saving himself from Rem while also saving her.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the process of saving her, Subaru, as well as the audience,
                  learns more about her personality and origins. It's discovered
                  that she is deeply loyal and protective of her twin sister,
                  and was tormented and tortured as a child. In fact, Rem
                  killing Subaru was an act meant to protect her and her sister
                  from the danger she thought he posed due to him having the
                  Witch's scent. While murder is obviously never dismissible,
                  the fact she was motivated by a desire to keep her family safe
                  definitely helped redeem her in the eyes of the audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Speaking of her family, Rem's disadvantages started from
                  practically the moment she was born. Rem and Ram are twin Oni,
                  which is something of a taboo in their culture, mainly due to
                  twins typically being weaker than the average Oni.
                  Surprisingly, despite being a twin, Ram was considered a
                  prodigy and even thought to be the second coming of the Oni
                  God before her horn was cut off by Faust and the Witch's Cult,
                  with Rem only being as powerful as the average Oni. Not only
                  did this cause her to develop a sense of inferiority towards
                  herself, especially when compared to her sister, but after
                  being attacked by the Witch's Cult, Rem felt it was her
                  responsibility to take care of and protect the weakened Ram.

                  Her origin story not only made her motivations more
                  understandable, but made her more likable as a result. It's
                  common for anime to have underdog characters that don't seem
                  particularly skilled as others. However, as most of these
                  characters tend to be main protagonists, they almost always
                  end up becoming the strongest character in the series, with
                  Naruto Uzumaki as a prime example of this. Rem doesn't have
                  the same plot armor as the Seventh Hokage, and as such her
                  ultimate fate is in no way guaranteed to be a happy one. It
                  adds weight to her underdog status, further endearing her to
                  fans.

                  Regardless of everything, her toughest uphill battle is easily
                  in romance. Rem is blatantly in love with Subaru. After saving
                  her from a curse as well as her own emotions, Rem ended up
                  seeing him as her hero, but Subaru is so infatuated with
                  Emilia that he can't even begin to feel anything romantic for
                  anyone else, even her. He even tells her how much he loves
                  Emilia and asks her to assist him when it comes to winning her
                  heart, which is rather heartbreaking. The situation becomes
                  even sadder when Rem's undying loyalty to Subaru is taken into
                  account, as despite her own feelings being rejected by him,
                  she refuses to leave his side and will follow him into any
                  danger.

                  Luffy minimizes his internal dialogue because he is impulsive
                  and grounded, and he feels no need to plan for the future or
                  calculate things. He is also very people-oriented and would
                  much rather tell someone what he feels than just think about
                  it. By contrast, some seinen heroes like Berserk's Guts and
                  Vinland Saga's Thorfinn Karlsefni also have relatively sparse
                  internal dialogue, but to a completely different effect. At
                  different points in their stories, Guts and Thorfinn were both
                  presented as bitter loners who hated the world, and they had
                  little internal dialogue. This helped make Guts and Thorfinn
                  more mysterious and sullen as standoffish antiheroes, treating
                  the audience the same way they treat the people around them --
                  with cold, unreadable silence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Guts is totally absorbed by his own problems and burdens, from
                  seeking revenge on Griffith to fighting monsters day and
                  night, and he's not too chatty about it with either the people
                  around him or the audience. That almost makes Guts introverted
                  on a meta level, and for a time, the same was true with
                  Thorfinn. Like Luffy, Guts and Thorfinn expressed themselves
                  with their actions and lived in the moment, so they had few
                  inner musings to share via internal dialogue. However, unlike
                  Luffy, Guts and Thorfinn did this because they were suffering
                  and unwilling to open up to others. In this way, a basic
                  literary technique can be used in wildly different ways,
                  demonstrating the true storytelling potential of manga.

                  Currently, Rem is in a coma due to having her name and
                  existence erased by the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony. She can't
                  wake up on her own, and nobody remembers who she is aside from
                  Subaru.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This coma has been hard for many fans, as it struck Rem in
                  Season 1 of Re:Zero and still hasn't been resolved. It also
                  further highlights what so many like about her character, and
                  that's her enduring quality. Regardless of how high the odds
                  are stacked against her, Rem always perseveres and does her
                  best to push through. Hopefully, this will help her wake up
                  soon.
